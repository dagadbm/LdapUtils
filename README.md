# Ldap Utils

This is a small Ldap Wrapper library made in Java 1.6 (easily upgradeable) which abstracts the entire LDAP logic.

Useful for maintenance tasks with LDAP such as bulk creations/deletions/modifications of users.

Enjoy.

P.S. I am new to git so feel free to suggest changes and improvements to my code and this awfully basic README file.
